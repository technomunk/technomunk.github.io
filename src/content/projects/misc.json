    "description": "I regularly write quick solutions or implement random ideas I get. This can be prototyping an idea that leads to a project (for example the cookbook server or the exploramap app), brainstorming a solution to a problem (voxelization, working out algebra), playing a coding-centric game (Screeps AI, bitburner, Farmer Was Replaced), contributing to an open source project with a bugfix or a minor feature improvement or just trying to entertain myself. These are too numerous and too small to list in detail.",
